  The Cowichan Valley, known as "The Warm Land", is located on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. It spreads from Mill Bay in the south, to Chemainus in the north, to Lake Cowichan to the west. The valley is centered on Duncan, the primary commercial city. <br><br>The valley is home to about 70,000 people. Except for Duncan and North Cowichan, population density is very low. Many rural homes are situated on large lots, or even acreages. <br><br>The Cowichan First Nation community is quite large and vibrant. The Cowichan have been known as excellent craftsmen for many generations. Carvings, knitting, and paintings, are some of the items that are traditionally made. Check out a fine selection at the <a target="_blank" title="Native Centre" href="http://www.quwutsun.ca/">Quw'utsun' Cultural and Conference Centre</a> and at <a target="_blank" title="Judy Hill Gallery" href="http://www.judyhillgallery.com/">the Judy Hill Gallery</a>.<br><br>Farming, forestry and fishing have been very important, economically, for well over 150 years in the Cowichan Valley, as they are today. Mining was historically important in the region, but is no longer economically viable.<br><br>
